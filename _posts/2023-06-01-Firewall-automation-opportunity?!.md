I'd like to introduce you a series of articles about "How we faced a firewall automation project", what did we take from this, what were mistakes we made (and hopefully learned from) etc. This initiative started with chats and dicsussions over a coffee, developed into more specific technical and design talks, led other stakeholders to a decision to outsorce some development to finally end up with an in-house approach while bying a software that we had to set up and plug-in into the whole ecosystem and processes that we were about to boost.

Automation has been a hot topic already for quite some time. And it effects greatly also (cyber)security, networking and related management. Nowadays, probably almost anything in IT can be **automated to some level** and we were havinf an opportunity to bring autmation also to the area of network security - firewall rules creation, rule deployment, security (infosec) approvals... well, the whole package including other teams and interaction of individuals.

I had to undergo (and I suggest you to spend some time on this as well) several steps which were rather managerial, communicational and design-wise rather than pure technical. Technical analysis and possibilites were (important as well, yes) but at the beginning rather simplified inputs and factors for opening and leading discussions. I guess, you're aware of it but I can't stress enough to firstly detect & confirm a need and a priority for this challenge and they openly discuss and buy appropriate stakeholders. This is not a project that only a one team would use and benefit from. If you decide to take this path you'll end up discussing:
- requirements of your company security team(s)
    - trying to find / align (existing) a process for firewall automation
- requirements of your network team(s)
- opinions and needs of other engineering teams that request fw rules, changes and actually (probably) run the product.


overlapping field. But it is crucial to find a right border with maximum added value and not wasting resources on trying to find perfect solution working without a human interaction.

In the realm of cybersecurity and network management, the integration of IP Address Management (IPAM), data quality practices, and firewall automation heralds a new era of efficiency, resilience, and progress for organizations worldwide.
