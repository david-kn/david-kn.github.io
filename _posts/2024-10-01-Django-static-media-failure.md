This article is intended as a "last resort" hint for those of you who are, likely in a corporate environment, struggling with static media failure or different, totally random yet repeated, unpredictable partial web page loading. If you've encountered anything ranging from odd behaviors (where static media or data sometimes load and sometimes don't) to situations where small static media files takek an incredibly long time (even up to 20 seconds) to load or fail altogether, This might be the fix you're looking for.

_I assume you wouldn't have ended up here, if a standard fix could help you (e.g. verifying the presence of files, checking folder ownership & permissions; ensuring  proper volume mounting in the case of docker(-compose), and troubleshooting NGINX configuration, routing, and load balancers :-)_

Like you, I checked and tried all the standard tips both on the django error page itself and those found online. I also checked both server configuration and network settings on other devices along the way... But the random, very slow time-to-time loading (what I call "strange behavior") made me wonder where the root cause was. Well, if nothing helped, try this: if you're unsure then **ask your network engineers if HTTPS inspection is enabled on any network element along the way**. If it ss, request them to disable or bypass it for your server to see if that resolved the issue. It did in my case — problem was solved and files were loaded smoothly!

I was really surprised to find this out because we had 2 instances of this app (using Django as the underlying backed) running like flawlessly without issues for years even with HTTPS ispection enabled. Then we recently launched another two new instances — one worked fine like the rest. But this last, the other server, oh boy — that was a troublemaker. Somehow, the CheckPoint firewall HTTPS inspection, significantly impacted the server communication and only when the HTTPS inspection was disabled (set to bypass that particular server) did the static media files load quickly and without any errors.

Looking back, some signs were there — AVI balancer logs contained some messages about timed-out requests and connections ended by the client etc. But as the other 3 system instances were runnig in a very similar / identical environment with the same network segmentation architecture, it didn't cross my mind to actually check the impacts of HTTPS inspection impact on my communication.
